> How can artists create new live performances during the time of COVID-19? Volumetric Performance Toolbox empowers creators to perform from their own living spaces for a virtual audience. Movement artist Valencia James performed publicly with the Toolbox for the first time on September 24, 2020 in the Mozilla Hubs virtual social space. The project is a collaboration between Valencia James, Glowbox and Sorob Louie as part of Eyebeamâ€™s Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future fellowship.

# vpt-stream

Inspired by depthkit.js (https://github.com/ScatterCo/Depthkit.js), this module will take a HLS live stream of stacked RGB and HLS encoded Depth frames and render it as a point cloud.
